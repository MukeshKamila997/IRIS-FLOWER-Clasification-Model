# IRIS-FLOWER-Classification-Model

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that we have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Our
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements
